# myChatbot

A sophisticated chatbot system that leverages vector database technology to intelligently process and retrieve information from PDF documents.

## Features

- PDF Document Processing: Automatically extracts and processes text from PDF files
- Vector Database Integration: Utilizes vector embeddings for efficient information storage and retrieval
- Semantic Search: Performs context-aware searches to find relevant information
- Natural Language Processing: Understands and responds to user queries in a conversational manner

## How It Works

1. Document Ingestion: The system processes PDF documents and breaks them down into manageable chunks
2. Vector Embedding: Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using advanced NLP models
3. Database Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval
4. Query Processing: User questions are processed and matched against stored information
5. Response Generation: Relevant information is retrieved and formatted into coherent responses
